# MIT 6.824: Distributed systems


This repository contains lab solutions for this course - http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/


I changed the project structure with two goals:
1) So that you cannot “copy and paste” if you are actually a student of this course
2) Bring it into line with some best practices for Go projects
